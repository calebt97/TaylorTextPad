# new-IDE
A VERY basic Notepad that I'll improve on, hopefully an IDE one day. Written purely in java
If you care to help me improve it, just email me. Any comments or suggestions would be really helpful

1.0: Allowed opening, closing and saving files within a JTextPane. Can change font size and style.

2.0: Allows specification of save/opening location using JFileDirectory. If file is saved as .java, it can run the code. 
However, the output is put in the console of IDE the developer is using. Improved the GUI, using JMenuItems and other tools.
Windowlistener gives the option of saving your work before the system exits.

2.1: A few bug fixes, and transferred GUI constructor to various static methods to increase readability.
